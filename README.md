Added a new query, scsJobModelMaint \_ GetOpenJobCountByJobModel which will be utilized by CLF:scsJobModelMaint_ValidateChange to check for open jobs. And, added a new label, scsJobModel_LinkOpenJobs to prompt an error message. This implementation will forbid user to modify any Job Model that has an active or open jobs assigned to it. The application will prompt an error message if user try to do so. To continue modify the Job Model, user need to either cancel or complete the job.                              | SM   | 2210    |

| When editing an existing computation instance using the Computation Expression field, the data type that was set in the Computation Parameter Specification grid changes to Integer on saving the updates. Regardless of the data type that was set, the changes made are overridden and change to Integer. This issue is also observed when a new computation instance is created or when the expression is updated. On saving a newly created instance or editing any part of the expression, the data type of the computation variables change to Integer. | Resolution: Updated the code, and now the changes made to the data type persist. Also, any other change made to the expression does not update the data type that was set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | CR   | 2304    |
